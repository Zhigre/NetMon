# NetMon
A simple Network Monitor program made by ChatGPT ONLY
-----------------------------------------------------

This project was to test out ChatGPT's coding ability as OpenAI evolves its AI model.

The current version (rev17) was made using the free GPT-4o model accessible through ChatGPT.

The limitations of this poject were that I couldn't correct any code errors manually, I could only copy/paste the entire code back and forth from ChatGPT and VS Code and use prompts to try to get ChatGPT to fix issues or add features.
